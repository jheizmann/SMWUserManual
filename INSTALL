-----------------------------------------------------

Install instructions for the latest version of User Manual Extension are also online:

 http://smwforum.ontoprise.com/smwforum/index.php/Help:Installing_User_Manual_Extension
 
Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.15.x
    SMWHalo 1.4.6 or higher
    ParserFunctions (optional)

Installation with the Deployment Framework:
===========================================

When you have the Deployment Framework installed then the setup is very easy:

   (1) On the server of your wiki installation open a command line window

   (2) Change to the directory of your wiki installation
       (e.g. /usr/share/mediawiki on Linux
        or C:\SMWPLUS\htdocs\mediawiki on Windows)

   (3) Change to the subdirectory deployment/tools

   (4) On Linux run the command: ./smwadmin.sh -i smwusermanual
       On Windows run the command: smwadmin.bat -i smwusermanual


Manual Installation:
====================

   (1) Unpack the zip file in the extension directory: /mediawiki_dir/extensions

	You should have the following structure:

      /mediawiki_dir/extensions/SMWUserManual/

       /includes
       /languages
       /maintenance
       /scripts
           /languages
      /skins

   (2) Edit your LocalSettings.php and add the following: 
   	   require_once("$IP/extensions/SMWUserManual/includes/SMW_UserManual.php");
       enableSMWUserManual();

   (3) Inside the mediawiki directory run the following command:
       php maintenance/importDump.php extensions/SMWUserManual/import/smwusermanual.xml

	This enables the SMWUserManual in your wiki and you will see a question mark
    on the right tab section (Ontoskin 3) or a help link below the tab section
    on the right side (all other skins).


Updating help articles:
=======================

The help articles are audited in the SMW+ Forum (http://smwforum.ontoprise.com).
We change them as new requirements come up and features change. Also user
feedback is included.
With the setup script in the maintenance directory you can always fetch
a new version of all help articles that are available.

   (1) Go into the maintenance directory of this extensions
       (e.g. /mediawiki_dir/exentsions/SMWUserManual/maintenance)

   (2) Execute the following command:
   	   php UME_setup.php -o

    This will read the articles from the SMWForum and import them into your
    wiki.
    This script will only update/delete any help articles. If will not remove
    any other articles that belong to this extension. To remove these, please
    make use of the Deployment Framework or do a query that selects all pages
    that have the annotation [[Part of bundle::Smwusermanual]].

    The setup script knows the following options:
        no option given: fetch all help articles from the SMW+ forum and install
                  these in your wiki.
        -d delete all help articles from your wiki
        -e fetch articles from the SMW+ forum and write them to a local xml file
        -i read a local xml file and import all help articles into your wiki
        -o overwrite must be set to overwrite existing help articles in your
           wiki with a new version. Also use this to overwrite and existing
           xml file when exporting the help articles
        --file=<filename> this is needed by the -e and -i switch, when the xml
           file is used to export or import help articles.

If you do not have the Parser Functions extension installed, modify the page
Template:Copyright_of_article that makes use of extension parser functions. More
information about that extension can be found here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:ParserFunctions


Configuration for the extension:
================================

The functionality of the SMWUserManual extension can be affected by
several options that can be set as variables. These must be put in the
LocalSettings.php after the require_once statement and before the
enableSMWUserManual() function call.

A detailed description of all variables and their meaning can be found
in the file SMW_UserManual.php in the includes directory.

Note: please look at the SMW_UserManual.php and setup your SMW+ account
if you want to submit rating and bug reports for your site.
