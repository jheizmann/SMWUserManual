Installation:

   (1) Unpack the zip file in the extension directory: /mediawiki_dir/extensions

	You should have the following structure:

      /mediawiki_dir/extensions/SMWUserManual/

       /includes
       /languages
       /maintenance
       /scripts
           /languages
      /skins

   (2) Edit your LocalSettings.php and add the following: 
   	   require_once("$IP/extensions/SMWUserManual/includes/SMW_UserManual.php"); enableSMWUserManual(); 

	This enables the SMWUserManual in your wiki and you will see a question mark on the right tab section 
	(Ontoskin 3) or a help link below the tab section on the right side (all other skins). 



Importing help articles:
========================

Before you are able to see any help articles, you have to import these.

   (1) Go into the maintenance directory of this extensions. There are two files:
          - SMW_setup.php
          - cshPages.xml 
   (2) Execute now the following command. This will read the articles from the XML file and import 
   	   them into your wiki: 
   	   
   	   php SMW_setup.php -i --file=cshPages.xml

	After the import, you can find the articles in Namespace:UserManual. All articles got the properties 
	"UME discourse state" and "UME link". 
	
	You can also download the latest version from the help articles 
	from the SMW+ forum. Then run simply the following command:

	php UME_setup.php

If you do not have the Parser Functions extension installed, modify the page Template:Copyright_of_article 
that makes use of parser functions [1] that come with this extension.

Updating the help articles:
===========================

The help articles are audited in the SMW+ Forum. We change them as new
requirements come up and features change. Also user feedback is included.
With the setup script in the maintenance directory you can always fetch
a new version of all help articles that are available. The setup script
know the following options:
 no option given: fetch all help articles from the SMW+ forum and install
                  these in your wiki.
 -d delete all help articles from your wiki
 -e fetch articles from the SMW+ forum and write them to a local xml file
 -i read a local xml file and import all help articles into your wiki
 -o overwrite must be set to overwrite existing help articles in your
    wiki with a new version. Also use this to overwrite and existing
    xml file when exporting the help articles
 --file=<filename> this is needed by the -e and -i switch, when the xml
                   file is used to export or import help articles.

Configuration for the extension:
================================

The functionality of the SMWUserManual extension can be affected by
several options that can be set as variables. These must be put in the
LocalSettings.php after the require_once statement and before the
enableSMWUserManual() function call.

A detailed description of all variables and their meaning can be found
in the file SMW_UserManual.php in the includes directory.
